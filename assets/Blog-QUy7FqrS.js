i am trying to figure out",caption:"What even is this"}],content:"How I Got Here\n\nStarted as a typical CS student, then discovered web development. Building things people can actually see and interact with? Addictive.\n\nThen came the hackathon. Built Redactly AI - a text redaction system with Python and spaCy. Didn't win, but suddenly I'm fascinated by making computers understand human language.\n\nCurrent Stack Chaos\n\nWeb Dev:\n• React (hooks everywhere)\n• Tailwind CSS (utility classes > everything)\n• Node.js APIs\n• That one PHP project we don't talk about\n\n{{image:setup}}\n\nData Science/ML:\n• Python notebooks (messy but functional)\n• spaCy from the hackathon\n• Pandas (still confusing)\n• scikit-learn experiments\n\nAcademic Stuff:\n• Java assignments\n• C++ that actually compiles\n• Database schemas\n\nWhat I'm Learning\n\n1. React development - This portfolio site\n2. Python & Data Science - Pandas, NumPy, datasets\n3. Machine Learning basics - Theory vs practice gap is real\n4. College coursework - Algorithms, databases, networks\n\nRandom Observations\n\nWeb Dev:\n• CSS is amazing and terrible simultaneously\n• React hooks make sense until they don't\n• \"Works on my machine\" is real\n\n{{image:react}}\n\nMachine Learning:\n• Data cleaning takes forever\n• Getting good data > building models\n• \"It's just statistics\" (very complicated statistics)\n\nStudent Life:\n• Balancing theory and practice is an art\n• Google and Stack Overflow = best friends\n• Not winning hackathons is totally fine\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nHonestly? No idea. Maybe deeper into transformers, maybe more web apps, maybe another hackathon.\n\nCurrently curious about:\n• Combining web dev + ML\n• TypeScript (everyone says I should learn it)\n• Docker (containers are confusing)\n• Finishing that side project from 3 months ago\n\nQuick Tech Questions\n\n• How do you scale React apps?\n• TensorFlow vs PyTorch - what's the deal?\n• Is Next.js actually better than React?\n• Why is deployment harder than development?\n\nMachine Learning Fascination\n\nStarted with linear regression, now reading about neural networks. The idea that computers can learn patterns from data just clicks with me.\n\nWhat makes sense:\n• Computers learning from data\n• Different algorithms for different problems\n• Data prep being 80% of the work\n\n{{image:learning}}\n\nStill confusing:\n• The math (working on it)\n• When to use which algorithm\n• Why models work in training but fail in real life\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nBeing a CS student in 2025 is weird. So much to learn, so many choices. Web dev? ML? Full-stack? Data science?\n\nFor now, I'm just building stuff and seeing what sticks. The hackathon taught me that \"working and learning\" beats \"perfect and theoretical.\"\n\nBack to debugging why my React component re-renders and why my ML model thinks everything is the same class...\n\nP.S. - If anyone knows how to make Pandas less confusing, let me know!",image:c,date:"2025-11-03",author:"R Ajay Kumar"},{id:2,title:"Harmony, Ethics & Technology: Towards a Better Future",excerpt:"Exploring how Universal Human Values and ethical thinking can guide technology development for a sustainable and equitable world.",images:[{id:"ethics",url:h,alt:"Ethics in technology",caption:"The intersection of technology and human values"},{id:"sustainability",url:"/Portfolio_webiste/assets/blog4-DMIB_LKU.png",alt:"Sustainable technology concept",caption:"Building technology for a better tomorrow"},{id:"harmony",url:"/Portfolio_webiste/assets/blog5-QkAukztO.jpeg",alt:"Technology in harmony with nature",caption:"Balancing innovation with responsibility"}],content:"The Innovation Paradox\n\nToday is the age of quick innovation. Artificial intelligence and smart gadgets, biotech and renewable energy—technology is transforming our world at breakneck pace.\n\nBut in this race to innovate, are we taking time to ask: \"Are we creating a future that's actually in harmony—with ourselves, with each other, and with the planet?\"\n\nThis is where the concept of Universal Human Values (UHV) comes into the picture. Based on ageless values of respect, balance, and responsibility, UHV encourages us to reimagine the way we live—and the way we innovate.\n\nEthics: The Hidden Framework of Innovation\n\nTechnology doesn't exist in a vacuum—it interacts with people, environments, and societies. That's why ethics becomes more crucial than ever.\n\nThe Amazon AI Recruiting Disaster\n\nConsider Amazon's artificial intelligence recruiting tool. Created to simplify the hiring process, it ended up discriminating against female applicants. Why? Because it was trained on historical data from a male-dominated tech industry. The system picked up the bias—and amplified it.\n\nLesson: Algorithms aren't impartial. Without ethical consideration, technology can accelerate inequality.\n\n{{image:ethics}}\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica Scandal\n\nOr consider the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where Facebook user data was harvested to influence political opinions during major elections. Millions had their privacy violated without consent.\n\nLesson: Ethics isn't about what's legal—it's about what's right.\n\nIn both cases, the absence of ethical thinking caused real-world harm—lost trust, skewed opportunities, and global outrage.\n\nHolistic Technology: Beyond the Bottom Line\n\nThe concept of holistic technology takes this further. It asks:\n\n• Who does this innovation serve?\n• What's the long-term impact on people and the planet?\n• Can this be sustainable, inclusive, and ethical simultaneously?\n\nTesla: The Green Paradox\n\nTesla is driving the shift to electric mobility—but lithium mining for EV batteries causes water depletion, child labor, and habitat destruction in places like South America and Congo.\n\nA \"green\" solution isn't enough if it causes harm elsewhere.\n\nGoogle's Project Sunroof ☀️\n\nConversely, Google's Project Sunroof uses AI to help homeowners install solar panels efficiently, reducing electricity bills and promoting clean energy without major trade-offs.\n\n{{image:sustainability}}\n\nThis exemplifies tech working in harmony with people and planet.\n\nHolistic thinking means designing not just for profit or performance, but for impact—on communities, ecosystems, and future generations.\n\nEthical Leadership: Setting the Standard\n\nModern leadership isn't just about profits—it's about responsibility.\n\nMicrosoft's AI Ethics\n\nMicrosoft has established ethical AI guidelines, ensuring new systems are transparent, reliable, and fair. They created an internal AI ethics board and refused to sell facial recognition to law enforcement without proper regulation.\n\nPatagonia's Mission\n\nPatagonia, the outdoor clothing company, weaves ethics into everything—recycling materials, donating profits to environmental causes. They even changed their mission statement to: \"We're in business to save our home planet.\"\n\nThese companies prove that ethics and success can coexist.\n\nThe Road Ahead: What We Must Do\n\nAs future engineers, developers, entrepreneurs, or innovators, the responsibility is ours. We're not just building apps or systems—we're building the future.\n\nTo create a truly sustainable and equitable world, we need to:\n\n1. Embed UHV principles in education and work\n2. Design human-centered, accessible technologies\n3. Assess ethical and environmental impact at every step\n4. Cultivate leadership with integrity and compassion\n\nMost importantly, we need to ask tough questions:\n\n\"Can I build this?\" vs. \"Should I build this?\"\n\n{{image:harmony}}\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nAs a CS student, I'm constantly amazed by what technology can do. But I'm also learning that with great power comes great responsibility.\n\nEvery line of code I write, every algorithm I implement, every system I design—these choices matter. They shape how people interact, how societies function, how our planet evolves.\n\nThe question isn't just whether our code compiles or our models achieve high accuracy. It's whether we're building a world we'd actually want to live in.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEthical literacy and systems thinking aren't \"nice-to-haves\"—they're non-negotiable in today's world.\n\nThe future needs leaders who are technically skilled but ethically grounded. Innovators who care not just about success—but about significance.\n\nLet's build technologies that don't just solve problems—but solve the right problems. Let's choose harmony over haste, values over vanity, and purpose over pure profit.\n\nBecause the future isn't something we inherit—it's something we design.\n\nLet's design it right.\n\n---\n\nWhat do you think?
